Place your MP4 video files here for the Bento card hover backgrounds.

Expected filenames:
- 1.mp4  (Shire Fuels card)
- 2.mp4  (Integrated Sales App card)
- 3.mp4  (Integrations card)
- 4.mp4  (Inventory Management card)
- 5.mp4  (Order Tracking card)

Notes:
- Keep files web-optimized (H.264/AAC, 720p or 1080p, short loops).
- Videos are muted, looped, and only play when the card is hovered.
- If a file is missing, a subtle placeholder message will appear.
